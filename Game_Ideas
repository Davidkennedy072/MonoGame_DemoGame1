Game Ideas:
Have monsters ranked into Tiers
Brave frontier has 8 tiers and lots of monsters (1800+1600) 
so lets use Brave frontier monsters as sprites for enemies and characters
The nice thing about brave frontier is the spirites can upgrade and change tiers. 

I checked out monster warlord and some of the sprities are useable. 

Using pokemon soft/friendly looking spirits for tiers below brave frontier spirites is a good idea. 

I am still not 100% sure about absorbing combat 
(when player and enemy collide a calculation for the amount of each enemy absorbed 
and the maximum increased is completed). 
eg: 
When a player attacks an enemy with higher wind, 
the player looses elemental energy but maximum increases

Crowns modify and allow more elements, life leech, healing per second, etc.
