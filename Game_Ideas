Game Ideas:
Have monsters ranked into Tiers
Brave frontier has 8 tiers and lots of monsters (1800+1600) 
so lets use Brave frontier monsters as sprites for enemies and characters
The nice thing about brave frontier is the spirites can upgrade and change tiers. 

I checked out monster warlord and some of the sprities are useable. 

Using pokemon soft/friendly looking spirits for tiers below brave frontier spirites is a good idea. 

I am still not 100% sure about absorbing combat 
(when player and enemy collide a calculation for the amount of each enemy absorbed 
and the maximum increased is completed). 
eg: 
When a player attacks an enemy with higher wind, 
the player looses elemental energy but maximum increases

Crowns modify and allow more elements, life leech, healing per second, etc. 

Elements can combine into 'higher' elements that have special effects and have a stronger weighting factor when it comes to damages.
Idea is player can combine one point of earth and one point of fire to create one point of magma. This takes both current and maximum point.

Crowns can unlock higher elements etc. Each species will have affinity for elements.
I want to add tile effects as well. Being on tiles will give players buffs and debuffs.
eg: being on sand decreases water and earth strength but increaes wind.
